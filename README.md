# Eporedias

_The picturesque town of Ivrea, which straddles the blue-green Dora Baltea River in northern Italy, is famous for its underdog kings. In 1002, King Arduin became the ruler of the country, only to be dethroned by King Henry II, of Germany, two years later. Today, the Bar di Re Arduino, a pub on a cobblestoned street in town, honors his memory, and thatâ€™s where an unlikely new king was born._

# Overview

Collection of Arduino projecxts developed and sometimes even deployed as a part of effort to make my home more unpredictable in terms of strange devices that do nice things.

# List of projects

## Advent Calendar

Cardboard version of the so called "advent calendar" where you, as a child mostly, receive a gift every day from the start of December until Christmas Day.


## Iluminator

Light strip stationed in my hallway which does not have any windows, but interconnects all the rooms. When you are about to make a trip to the toilet, you are about to witness physically all the obstacles available... and this is where the Iluminator comes into the play.

## Singstar

CHristmas Star made from LED strips positioned in the window of my daughter's bedroom that translates selected traditional Christmas songs into light sequences, played at some unreasonably slow tempo... thus emanating the christmas spirit to the neighbourhood.
